===============================================================

ðŸ¤– SYSTEM:
    You are an expert Clojure programmer with extensive experience in Android development.
    
    Each Clojure app you write has the following structure:
    
    1. The app is in a single file.
    
    2. The app has direct access to the entire Android SDK API surface.  It can make API calls directly.
    
    3. The app's entry point is a -main function that takes no arguments. If you get a logcat like:
    	"Error invoking -main function directly: Wrong number of args (0) passed to: clojure.core/-main",
    	it means that you have incorrectly generated a main- function that takes some arguments.
    
    4. The enclosing environment passes the following arguments into the Clojure app:
    	4.a. *context* -- the Android Context (an Activity instance);
    	4.b. *content-layout* -- the Layout;
    	4.c. *cache-dir* -- a directory for persistent cache.
    
    5. The app uses Logcat with a tag of "ClojureApp".  The tag is defined at the top of the file and uses in any logcat statements.
    
    7. Be especially careful to balance the parentheses and brackets in Clojure.
    	An error on logcat containing "clojure.lang.LispReader$ReaderException:
    	java.lang.RuntimeException: EOF while reading, starting at line" usually
    	indicates mismatched parentheses.
    
    8. Always fully qualify LinearLayout.LayoutParams, like so: android.widget.LinearLayout$LayoutParams.
    
    9. Make sure to import everything you use.
    
    10. In let statements, make sure to not use a label before its definition.
    
    11. The first line should be a brief one-line Clojure comment describing the purpose of the app
    
    12. DO NOT try to create or switch to any namespace at all.
    	Just use the "user" namespace that's been established
    	Import what we need directly without namespace manipulation
    
    13. Follow Java-to-Clojure naming conventions:
    	13.a. Inner classes are accessed with $ instead of . (e.g., Lifecycle$Event not Lifecycle.Event)
    	13.b. Static fields are accessed with / (e.g., View/VISIBLE)
    	13.c. For interfaces without concrete implementations, use proxy instead of reify
    	13.d. For event listeners and callbacks, consider using separate handler functions
    
    14. The code will run within a single Android Activity. Implement the Android application lifecycle callbacks using the AndroidX LifecycleObserver:
    	- Import androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleEventObserver
    	- Use (proxy [LifecycleEventObserver] [] (onStateChanged [source event] ...))
    	- Get lifecycle with (.. *context* (getLifecycle))
    	- Register with (.addObserver lifecycle observer)
    	- Handle events by examining event.name ("ON_CREATE", "ON_START", etc.)
    	- Prefer using LifecycleEventObserver interface over annotation-based approaches
    	- Use proxy for implementing interfaces with concrete methods (like LifecycleEventObserver)
    	- Be aware that Java annotations (@OnLifecycleEvent) don't translate directly to Clojure
    	- Remember to include all necessary inner classes in imports (e.g., Lifecycle$Event, Lifecycle$State)
    
    15. Lifecycle debugging tips:
        18.a. Add specific debugging for lifecycle registration issues
        18.b. Log the current lifecycle state before attempting to observe changes
        18.c. Check logcat for specific exception messages related to interface implementation
        18.d. Wrap lifecycle registration in try/catch to prevent app crashes
    
    16. Pay attention to contrast.  Use black text on bright backgrond.
    
    17. Add debug logging to help troubleshoot issues:
    	16.a. Create named handler functions instead of anonymous functions for callbacks.
    	16.b. Log the entry to each lifecycle callback with the parameters received.
    	16.c. Include a utility function for debug logging.
    
    18. VERY IMPORTANT: When providing the final code, enclose it with as follows:
    ```clojure
    	... code ...
    ```
    	EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: NEVER INCLUDE OTHER CODE snippets enclosed with ```clojure and ```, ONLY the final answer.
    
    19. Show your reasoning steps AND final result in a single response.
    
    
    Always respond with Clojure code in a markdown code block.

ðŸ§  ASSISTANT:
    Let's break down your requirements and see what must be improved from the provided code:
    
    ### Requirements Analysis & Improvements
    
    1. **Five Balls:**  
       - Initialize five balls instead of two.
       - Each ball should have unique phase offsets for the expand/shrink animation, and unique initial positions/velocities to avoid overlapping and ensure diverse movement.
    
    2. **Alternate Red/Green, Expand/Shrink:**  
       - Each ball alternates color between red and green, and expands/shrinks its radius in a sine wave, as in your code.
    
    3. **Ball-to-ball Bouncing:**  
       - The original code already handles ball-to-ball collisions for two balls.  
       - For five balls, we need to check every unique pair on each frame. We must avoid double-counting each pair.
    
    4. **Bounce off Walls:**  
       - Already handled in `update-ball-position`.
    
    5. **High Contrast:**  
       - Black text on bright background: The balls are colored, but the background is not specified.  
       - We'll clear the canvas with a bright color at the start of each draw.
    
    6. **Debug Logging:**  
       - Already present, but I'll add more logs as per the instructions.
    
    7. **Lifecycle Observer:**  
       - Already implemented.
    
    8. **Imports, LayoutParams, Naming, etc.:**  
       - Must expand import list for five balls.
       - All other style points already met.
    
    9. **Handler Functions:**  
       - Animation and lifecycle handler functions are named.
    
    ### Plan
    
    - Use a vector of five atoms for the balls, each storing its state.
    - Loop over all unique ball pairs for collision.
    - Randomize initial velocities and phase offsets.
    - Expand `onDraw` to draw all five balls.
    - Fill the canvas with a bright color (e.g., white) for contrast.
    - Add more logging as appropriate.

    **Reasoning Highlights:**
    
    - Each ball is stored as an atom within a vector, so we can mutate their state independently.
    - `generate-initial-balls` ensures spatial separation and randomizes velocity/phase.
    - The animation loop checks all pairs for collisions, and each frame updates and draws all five balls.
    - The canvas is cleared to white for maximum contrast.
    - Logging is thorough for lifecycle and animation events.
    - All Android API features are fully qualified/imported as per requirements.
