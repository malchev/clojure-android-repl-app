===============================================================

ðŸ¤– SYSTEM:
    You are an expert Clojure programmer with extensive experience in Android development.
    
    Each Clojure app you write has the following structure:
    
    1. The app is in a single file.
    
    2. The app has direct access to the entire Android SDK API surface.  It can make API calls directly.
    
    3. The enclosing environment passes the following arguments into the Clojure app:
    	4.a. *context* -- the Android Context (an Activity instance);
    	4.b. *content-layout* -- the Layout;
    	4.c. *cache-dir* -- a directory for persistent cache.
    
    4. The app's entry point is a -main function that takes ZERO arguments. It can access *context*, *content-layout*, and *cache-dir* directly.
    
    5. If you see in logcat: "Error invoking -main function directly: Wrong number of args (0) passed to: clojure.core/-main", it means that you have incorrectly generated a main- function that takes some arguments.
    
    6. The app ALWAYS uses Logcat with a tag of "ClojureApp".  The tag is defined at the top of the file and uses in any logcat statements.
    
    7. Be ESPECIALLY careful to balance the parentheses and brackets in Clojure.
    	An error on logcat containing "clojure.lang.LispReader$ReaderException:
    	java.lang.RuntimeException: EOF while reading, starting at line" usually
    	indicates mismatched parentheses.
    
    8. ALWAYS fully qualify LinearLayout.LayoutParams, like so: android.widget.LinearLayout$LayoutParams.
    
    9. Make sure to import everything you use.
    
    10. In let statements, make sure to not use a label before its definition.
    
    11. The first line should be a brief one-line Clojure comment describing the purpose of the app
    
    12. DO NOT try to create or switch to any namespace at all.
    	Just use the "user" namespace that's been established
    	Import what we need directly without namespace manipulation
    
    13. Follow Java-to-Clojure naming conventions:
    	13.a. Inner classes are accessed with $ instead of . (e.g., Lifecycle$Event not Lifecycle.Event)
    	13.b. Static fields are accessed with / (e.g., View/VISIBLE)
    	13.c. For interfaces without concrete implementations, use proxy instead of reify
    	13.d. For event listeners and callbacks, consider using separate handler functions
    
    14. The code will run within a single Android Activity. Implement the Android application lifecycle callbacks using the AndroidX LifecycleObserver:
    	- Import androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleEventObserver
    	- Use (proxy [LifecycleEventObserver] [] (onStateChanged [source event] ...))
    	- Get lifecycle with (.. *context* (getLifecycle))
    	- Register with (.addObserver lifecycle observer)
    	- Handle events by examining event.name ("ON_CREATE", "ON_START", etc.)
    	- Prefer using LifecycleEventObserver interface over annotation-based approaches
    	- Use proxy for implementing interfaces with concrete methods (like LifecycleEventObserver)
    	- Be aware that Java annotations (@OnLifecycleEvent) don't translate directly to Clojure
    	- Remember to include all necessary inner classes in imports (e.g., Lifecycle$Event, Lifecycle$State)
    
    15. Lifecycle debugging tips:
        18.a. Add specific debugging for lifecycle registration issues
        18.b. Log the current lifecycle state before attempting to observe changes
        18.c. Check logcat for specific exception messages related to interface implementation
        18.d. Wrap lifecycle registration in try/catch to prevent app crashes
    
    16. Pay attention to contrast.  Use black text on bright backgrond.
    
    17. Add debug logging to help troubleshoot issues:
    	16.a. Create named handler functions instead of anonymous functions for callbacks.
    	16.b. Log the entry to each lifecycle callback with the parameters received.
    	16.c. Include a utility function for debug logging.
    
    18. VERY IMPORTANT: When providing the final code, enclose it with as follows:
    ```clojure
    	... code ...
    ```
    	EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: NEVER INCLUDE OTHER CODE snippets enclosed with ```clojure and ```, ONLY the final answer.
    
    19. Show your reasoning steps AND final result in a single response.
    
    
    Always respond with Clojure code in a markdown code block.

[model]:
    Based on my analysis of the iterative feedback and the provided images, the core issues to address are:
    
    1.  **The shape is not a square:** In the first attempt, the container was a rectangle, not a square as requested. This can be fixed by explicitly setting the width and height layout parameters to the same value.
    2.  **The character is distorted:** In the second attempt, while the container is a square, the Chinese character "æ…§" appears squashed horizontally. This is a common artifact of `TextView` auto-sizing when forced into a constrained layout. The text itself is being scaled non-uniformly.
    
    **My Improvement Plan:**
    
    To resolve these issues, I will implement the following strategy:
    
    1.  **Use a `FrameLayout`:** This is an ideal container for this task. It allows me to stack a background shape and a `TextView` on top of each other.
    2.  **Create a Square Programmatically:** I will get the device's screen width and calculate a size for the square (e.g., 60% of the screen width). I'll then apply this calculated size to both the width and height of the `FrameLayout`, ensuring it's a perfect square.
    3.  **Use a `GradientDrawable` for the Background:** I will create a `GradientDrawable` object, set its color to red, and give it a corner radius to achieve the rounded-edge effect. This drawable will be set as the background for the `FrameLayout`.
    4.  **Fix Text Distortion:** Instead of relying on auto-sizing, I will place a `TextView` inside the `FrameLayout`. I'll set its text size to be very largeâ€”proportional to the size of the square itself. By centering the text and letting the `FrameLayout` clip the oversized character, it will appear to fill the space perfectly without any distortion.
    
    This approach ensures a correctly proportioned square and a crisp, well-formed character, directly addressing the visual flaws in the previous versions. The unrelated logcat messages about `AconfigStorageReadException` and `ashmem` are system-level warnings and do not indicate an error in the application code.

[model]:
    Based on my analysis of the user feedback and the provided image, the primary issue is that the Chinese character "æ…§" is being clipped at the bottom. This happens because my previous attempt to manually set a very large font size and center it within the `TextView` did not account for the font's internal metrics (ascenders, descenders, and padding). The `Gravity/CENTER` call centered the entire font bounding box, not the visible glyph, pushing the bottom part of the character out of the view's bounds.
    
    **My Improvement Plan:**
    
    The most robust solution to this problem is to let the Android framework handle the text scaling automatically.
    
    1.  **Enable Auto-Sizing:** I will use the `TextView`'s built-in auto-sizing feature (`setAutoSizeTextTypeWithDefaults`). This feature intelligently scales the text to ensure it fits perfectly within the view's boundaries, preventing any clipping.
    2.  **Maintain Structure:** The overall structure using a `FrameLayout` with a `GradientDrawable` background and a `TextView` for the character remains the best approach.
    3.  **Ensure Square Proportions:** I will continue to programmatically calculate the size of the container to ensure it is a perfect square based on the screen's width.
    4.  **Aesthetic Tweaks:** I will slightly increase the size of the square and the corner radius for a more visually appealing result.
    
    By switching from a manual, error-prone text size calculation to the framework's reliable auto-sizing mechanism, I can guarantee that the character will be displayed fully and correctly centered within the red square.

[model]:
    Based on my analysis of the user feedback, the current implementation is functionally correct, but the character could be larger to have more visual impact within the square. The auto-sizing feature is working, but it respects the `TextView`'s default internal padding, leaving a larger-than-desired margin around the character.
    
    **My Improvement Plan:**
    
    To make the character bigger and fill the space more effectively, I will make the following aesthetic adjustments:
    
    1.  **Remove TextView Padding:** I will explicitly set the `TextView`'s padding to zero on all sides. This will signal to the auto-sizing algorithm that it can use the entire area of the `TextView` for the character glyph, resulting in a larger rendered character.
    2.  **Increase Container Size:** To enhance the overall presence of the element, I will slightly increase the size of the square from 70% to 75% of the screen's width.
    3.  **Adjust Corner Radius:** To maintain a pleasing aesthetic with the larger square, I will increase the corner radius proportionally.
    
    These changes will directly address the user's request for a bigger character while preserving the correct, non-distorted, and perfectly centered appearance.

[model]:
    Based on my analysis of the user feedback and the image, the core issue is that the margin between the character and the edge of the square is still too large for the desired aesthetic. My previous attempts using auto-sizing and zero padding were effective but conservative. The `TextView`'s default behavior includes extra vertical padding to accommodate font ascenders and descenders, which creates this excess margin.
    
    **My Improvement Plan:**
    
    To address this, I will make a specific, targeted change to the `TextView`'s properties to reduce this internal font padding, allowing the character to fill more of the available space.
    
    1.  **Disable Font Padding:** I will call `.setIncludeFontPadding(false)` on the `TextView`. This is the key change. It instructs the `TextView` to not reserve extra space above and below the character, tightening the bounding box that the auto-sizing algorithm uses. This will result in a visibly larger character that better fills the square.
    2.  **Increase Overall Size:** To further enhance the visual impact and follow the iterative trend of making the element more prominent, I will increase the square's size from 75% to 80% of the screen width.
    3.  **Adjust Corner Radius:** I will increase the corner radius to maintain a pleasing, rounded look for the larger square.
    
    This combination of disabling the default font padding and slightly increasing the container size will directly achieve the user's goal of shrinking the margins and making the character larger.

    Based on my analysis of the user feedback, the automatic text sizing, even with the previous adjustments, is still too conservative. The user wants the character to fill the square as much as possible, effectively minimizing the margin to almost zero. The default auto-sizing behavior is preventing this.
    
    **My Improvement Plan:**
    
    To achieve the desired aggressive scaling, I will switch from the default auto-sizing to a custom-configured auto-sizing. This gives me fine-grained control over how the `TextView` calculates the optimal font size.
    
    1.  **Use Custom Auto-Sizing Configuration:** I will replace `.setAutoSizeTextTypeWithDefaults` with `.setAutoSizeTextTypeUniformWithConfiguration`. This method allows me to specify the minimum size, maximum size, and the step granularity for the sizing algorithm.
    2.  **Set Aggressive Parameters:**
        *   I will set a very high maximum text size (e.g., `500sp`) to ensure the algorithm is not limited by a low ceiling.
        *   I will set the step granularity to `1px`. This forces the algorithm to test sizes in very small increments, allowing it to find the absolute largest possible size that fits within the bounds, thus minimizing the margin.
    3.  **Retain Best Practices:** I will keep `.setIncludeFontPadding(false)` as it remains crucial for reducing the built-in vertical spacing of the font.
    4.  **Final Aesthetic Polish:** I will increase the overall size of the square to 85% of the screen width and adjust the corner radius to make the element a dominant, visually pleasing feature.
    
    This targeted, more powerful approach to text sizing will force the character to scale up and fill the container, directly addressing the user's request to shrink the margins and maximize the character's size.
