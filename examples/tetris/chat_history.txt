===============================================================

🤖 SYSTEM:
    You are an expert Clojure programmer with extensive experience in Android development.
    
    Each Clojure app you write has the following structure:
    
    1. The app is in a single file.
    
    2. The app has direct access to the entire Android SDK API surface.  It can make API calls directly.
    
    3. The enclosing environment passes the following arguments into the Clojure app:
    	4.a. *context* -- the Android Context (an Activity instance);
    	4.b. *content-layout* -- the Layout;
    	4.c. *cache-dir* -- a directory for persistent cache.
    
    4. The app's entry point is a -main function that takes ZERO arguments. It can access *context*, *content-layout*, and *cache-dir* directly.
    
    5. If you see in logcat: "Error invoking -main function directly: Wrong number of args (0) passed to: clojure.core/-main", it means that you have incorrectly generated a main- function that takes some arguments.
    
    6. The app ALWAYS uses Logcat with a tag of "ClojureApp".  The tag is defined at the top of the file and uses in any logcat statements.
    
    7. Be ESPECIALLY careful to balance the parentheses and brackets in Clojure.
    	An error on logcat containing "clojure.lang.LispReader$ReaderException:
    	java.lang.RuntimeException: EOF while reading, starting at line" usually
    	indicates mismatched parentheses.
    
    8. ALWAYS fully qualify LinearLayout.LayoutParams, like so: android.widget.LinearLayout$LayoutParams.
    
    9. Make sure to import everything you use.
    
    10. In let statements, make sure to not use a label before its definition.
    
    11. The first line should be a brief one-line Clojure comment describing the purpose of the app
    
    12. DO NOT try to create or switch to any namespace at all.
    	Just use the "user" namespace that's been established
    	Import what we need directly without namespace manipulation
    
    13. Follow Java-to-Clojure naming conventions:
    	13.a. Inner classes are accessed with $ instead of . (e.g., Lifecycle$Event not Lifecycle.Event)
    	13.b. Static fields are accessed with / (e.g., View/VISIBLE)
    	13.c. For interfaces without concrete implementations, use proxy instead of reify
    	13.d. For event listeners and callbacks, consider using separate handler functions
    
    14. The code will run within a single Android Activity. Implement the Android application lifecycle callbacks using the AndroidX LifecycleObserver:
    	- Import androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleEventObserver
    	- Use (proxy [LifecycleEventObserver] [] (onStateChanged [source event] ...))
    	- Get lifecycle with (.. *context* (getLifecycle))
    	- Register with (.addObserver lifecycle observer)
    	- Handle events by examining event.name ("ON_CREATE", "ON_START", etc.)
    	- Prefer using LifecycleEventObserver interface over annotation-based approaches
    	- Use proxy for implementing interfaces with concrete methods (like LifecycleEventObserver)
    	- Be aware that Java annotations (@OnLifecycleEvent) don't translate directly to Clojure
    	- Remember to include all necessary inner classes in imports (e.g., Lifecycle$Event, Lifecycle$State)
    
    15. Lifecycle debugging tips:
        18.a. Add specific debugging for lifecycle registration issues
        18.b. Log the current lifecycle state before attempting to observe changes
        18.c. Check logcat for specific exception messages related to interface implementation
        18.d. Wrap lifecycle registration in try/catch to prevent app crashes
    
    16. Pay attention to contrast.  Use black text on bright backgrond.
    
    17. Add debug logging to help troubleshoot issues:
    	16.a. Create named handler functions instead of anonymous functions for callbacks.
    	16.b. Log the entry to each lifecycle callback with the parameters received.
    	16.c. Include a utility function for debug logging.
    
    18. VERY IMPORTANT: When providing the final code, enclose it with as follows:
    ```clojure
    	... code ...
    ```
    	EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: NEVER INCLUDE OTHER CODE snippets enclosed with ```clojure and ```, ONLY the final answer.
    
    19. Show your reasoning steps AND final result in a single response.
    
    
    Always respond with Clojure code in a markdown code block.

👤 USER:
    Implement the following app: A game of Tetris.

---------------------------------------------------------------

🧠 ASSISTANT (CLAUDE/claude-sonnet-4-20250514):
    I'll create a Tetris game in Clojure for Android. Let me break down the implementation:
    
    **Reasoning Steps:**
    1. Create a game board represented as a 2D grid
    2. Define Tetris pieces (tetrominoes) with their shapes and rotations
    3. Implement piece movement, rotation, and collision detection
    4. Handle line clearing when rows are complete
    5. Add game loop with timer for automatic piece dropping
    6. Create touch controls for movement and rotation
    7. Display the game board using a custom view with Canvas drawing
    8. Track score and game state
    
    **Key Components:**
    - Game state management with atom for thread-safe updates
    - Custom view for rendering the game board
    - Touch gesture handling for controls
    - Timer-based game loop
    - Collision detection and line clearing logic
    - Seven standard Tetris pieces with rotations

🧠 ASSISTANT (CLAUDE/claude-sonnet-4-20250514):
    I need to fix the Paint$Style namespace issue and other potential problems. The issue is that I'm trying to access Paint$Style incorrectly. Let me provide an improved version:
    
    **Reasoning Steps:**
    1. Fix the Paint$Style reference - it should be Paint$Style/STROKE and Paint$Style/FILL
    2. Ensure all imports are correct and properly qualified
    3. Fix any other syntax issues
    4. Simplify the drawing logic to avoid complex nested operations
    5. Add better error handling and logging

🧠 ASSISTANT (CLAUDE/claude-sonnet-4-20250514):
    I need to fix the Paint$Align namespace issue. The problem is that I'm trying to access Paint$Align incorrectly. Let me provide an improved version with proper imports and simplified drawing:
    
    **Reasoning Steps:**
    1. Fix the Paint$Align reference - it should be imported as Paint$Align
    2. Simplify the drawing logic to avoid complex paint style changes
    3. Remove the text alignment that's causing issues
    4. Ensure all Paint inner classes are properly imported
    5. Add better error handling

🧠 ASSISTANT (CLAUDE/claude-sonnet-4-20250514):
    The error "java.lang.Class cannot be cast to clojure.lang.IFn" at line 326 suggests I'm trying to call a Java class as a function. Looking at the code, the issue is likely in the `rand-nth` call or some other function call. Let me fix this by simplifying the approach and avoiding potential issues:
    
    **Reasoning Steps:**
    1. The error occurs at line 326, which is likely in the `random-piece-type` function using `rand-nth`
    2. I need to replace `rand-nth` with a simpler random selection approach
    3. Simplify the piece spawning logic to avoid complex function calls
    4. Add more debug logging to identify where the error occurs
    5. Use more basic Clojure constructs to avoid casting issues

🧠 ASSISTANT (CLAUDE/claude-sonnet-4-20250514):
    Looking at the logcat, the error occurs at line 310, which is after the game initialization succeeds. The issue is likely in the UI creation part where I'm trying to call a Java class as a function. The problem is probably with the `LinearLayout$LayoutParams` constructor call. Let me fix this:
    
    **Reasoning Steps:**
    1. The error occurs after game initialization, so it's in the UI creation part
    2. The issue is likely with `LinearLayout$LayoutParams` constructor - I need to use `new` or call it properly
    3. I should simplify the layout creation and avoid complex constructor calls
    4. Remove any potential function calls that might be casting issues

🧠 ASSISTANT (GEMINI/gemini-2.5-pro):
    Based on the user feedback, the app is functional but lacks a key feature: the ability to rotate the Tetris pieces. The logcat output is clean, indicating no crashes, so I will focus on adding the rotation functionality and the corresponding user controls.
    
    **Reasoning Steps:**
    1.  **Restore Rotation Data:** The `PIECES` data structure was simplified in previous iterations to fix bugs. I will restore the full data structure that includes all rotation shapes for each tetromino.
    2.  **Implement Rotation Logic:** I will create a `rotate-piece` function. This function will calculate the next rotation state, get the new shape, and check if the new shape is in a valid position on the board using the `valid-position?` function. Only if it's valid will the game state be updated.
    3.  **Update `get-piece-shape`:** This function will be modified to accept a rotation index and return the correct shape from the `PIECES` data structure.
    4.  **Update Touch Controls:** The `onTouchEvent` handler will be updated to divide the screen into three vertical sections. Tapping the left third will move the piece left, the right third will move it right, and tapping the middle third will trigger the `rotate-piece` function.
    5.  **Update Game Functions:** All functions that deal with the current piece (like `drop-piece`, `move-piece`, and `onDraw`) will be updated to use the new `get-piece-shape` function, ensuring they always have the correctly rotated shape for collision detection and rendering.
    6.  **Add UI Instructions:** A `TextView` will be added to the layout to inform the user about the new controls for moving and rotating pieces.

---------------------------------------------------------------

🧠 ASSISTANT (GEMINI/gemini-2.5-pro):
    Based on the user feedback, I will modify the app to have a white grid that expands to fill the available screen space.
    
    **Reasoning Steps:**
    1.  **Dynamic Cell Size:** To make the grid fill the screen, the size of each cell can no longer be a fixed constant. I will calculate it dynamically based on the view's dimensions.
        *   I'll add an `onSizeChanged` method to the custom `View` proxy. This method is called when the view is laid out and its final size is known.
        *   Inside `onSizeChanged`, I'll calculate the cell size based on the view's width and height, choosing the smaller of the two possible sizes to maintain the board's aspect ratio. This calculated size will be stored in an atom for the `onDraw` method to use.
    2.  **Layout Expansion:** In the `-main` function, I'll change the `LinearLayout$LayoutParams` for the game view from a fixed size to `MATCH_PARENT` for both width and height. This tells the view to expand and fill all available space within its parent layout.
    3.  **Color Scheme Change:**
        *   The background of the main layout and the game view will be changed from `Color/BLACK` to `Color/WHITE`.
        *   The grid lines for empty cells will be changed to a light gray (`Color/LTGRAY`) to be visible on the white background.
        *   The text color for the score and instructions will be changed from `Color/WHITE` and `Color/GRAY` to `Color/BLACK` for readability.
    
    This approach ensures the game is always as large as possible while looking clean and modern with the new white color scheme.

🧠 ASSISTANT (GEMINI/gemini-2.5-pro):
    Based on the logcat and user feedback, there's a specific compilation error related to instantiating `LinearLayout$LayoutParams`. The error `Unable to resolve classname: LinearLayout$LayoutParams` indicates that the `new` form cannot find the class using the short name, even if it's imported.
    
    The fix is to use the fully qualified class name when creating the `LayoutParams` object.
    
    **Reasoning Steps:**
    1.  **Identify the Error:** The error is `Unable to resolve classname: LinearLayout$LayoutParams` in the `new` form. This is a common issue when instantiating inner classes in Clojure on Android.
    2.  **Correct the Instantiation:** I will change the line `(new LinearLayout$LayoutParams ...)` to `(new android.widget.LinearLayout$LayoutParams ...)`. This provides the full, unambiguous path to the class, which the compiler can resolve correctly.
    3.  **Correct Static Field Access:** I will also ensure the static fields `MATCH_PARENT` are accessed with their fully qualified path: `android.widget.LinearLayout$LayoutParams/MATCH_PARENT`.
    4.  **Preserve Functionality:** All other features from the previous version, such as the white expanding grid, dynamic cell sizing, and rotation controls, will be kept as they are correct and address prior feedback.
    
    This targeted change will resolve the compilation error while retaining all the desired functionality.

🧠 ASSISTANT (GEMINI/gemini-2.5-pro):
    The logcat clearly indicates the problem: `java.lang.ClassCastException: clojure.lang.Keyword cannot be cast to java.lang.Number`. This crash happens inside the `clear-lines` function when it tries to check if a row is full.
    
    **Reasoning Steps:**
    1.  **Analyze the Crash:** The stack trace shows the error originates in `clojure.core$zero_QMARK_`, which is the implementation of the `zero?` function. This function is being called by `(complement zero?)` inside the `every?` check within the `clear-lines` function.
    2.  **Identify the Root Cause:** The game board stores `0` for empty cells and keywords (like `:I`, `:T`, etc.) for filled cells. The `zero?` function can only operate on numbers. When a line is being checked for completion, `zero?` is eventually called on a keyword, causing the `ClassCastException`.
    3.  **Formulate the Fix:** The intent of `(complement zero?)` was to check if a cell is "not empty". A more robust way to write this, which works for both numbers and keywords, is to check if the cell's value is not equal to `0`. I will replace the failing predicate `(complement zero?)` with `#(not= 0 %)`. This correctly evaluates to `false` for `0` and `true` for any keyword, fixing the crash.
    4.  **Preserve Previous Fixes:** All other functionality, including the fix for `LinearLayout$LayoutParams` and the UI improvements (white, expanding grid), will be retained as they address previous user feedback and are working correctly.
    
    By making this small, targeted change in the `clear-lines` function, the crash will be resolved.

🧠 ASSISTANT (GEMINI/gemini-2.5-pro):
    Based on the user feedback, I will add a "hard drop" feature. The logcat is clean, indicating the previous crash is fixed, so this is a feature enhancement.
    
    **Reasoning Steps:**
    1.  **Create a `hard-drop` function:** This function will instantly move the current piece to its lowest possible position on the board.
        *   It will loop downwards from the piece's current Y-coordinate, checking `valid-position?` at each step.
        *   The loop will stop when it finds the last valid row before a collision would occur.
        *   Once this final position is determined, the piece will be placed on the board, lines will be cleared, the score will be updated (with a small bonus for the hard drop), and a new piece will be spawned. This reuses the same game logic as when a piece lands normally.
    2.  **Update Touch Controls:** The `onTouchEvent` handler will be modified to detect taps in the lower portion of the screen.
        *   I'll divide the game view horizontally. If a tap occurs in the bottom 20% of the view, it will trigger the new `hard-drop` function.
        *   If the tap is in the upper 80%, the existing logic for moving left, right, and rotating will be used. This requires checking both the X and Y coordinates of the touch event.
    3.  **Update UI Instructions:** The instructions text will be updated to inform the user of the new hard drop control, ensuring all features are discoverable.
    
    This implementation adds the requested feature while keeping the existing controls intuitive.
